# Larson_Scanner using Arduino Uno R3

This project is merely an exercise to understand and implement the basics of embedded system devices (Arduino Uno R3 in this case). 
This is my version of the Larson Scanner implemented on TinkerCAD; the link to the following sketch is found below: 
  https://www.tinkercad.com/things/9acZBzF07nD

##Usage
The code for the said circuit (found in ``Larson_Scanner_Circuit.png`` in the ``main`` branch ) is demonstrated in ``main.cpp``. 
This code can be implemented on an Arduino Uno R3 board and is compatible with Arduino IDE.
